        <h1>6 Sneaker Trends to Look Out for In 2025</h1>
        <div>This year, no fashion item has made headlines quite like Adidas Sambas. They were everywhere until they became too popular, prompting some people to sell them, some to bury them in their wardrobes, and some to ignore the noise and wear them regardless. By contrast, the sneaker trends that have defined the latter half of this year–and those forecast for next–suggest many people are striving for anti-mainstream designs. In an effort to avoid another Samba saturation situation, new-gen style fans have taken to customizing tennis shoes with charms, chains, ribbons, and colorful laces, or have unearthed lesser-known archive styles as an alternative to those in the spotlight.

            Of course, there has been a conveyor belt of cult styles that, like Sambas, have been worn by what feels like every celebrity and It-person (strategic seeding is partly to thank for this). In no particular order: Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66s, Puma Speedcats, and various New Balance models (9060s, 530s, 574s, and Aimé Leon Dore’s collab versions) have been popular this year. And best believe that crowds at Oasis’s reunion tour next summer will be two-stepping in Gallagher-inspired Adidas trainers (Liam Gallagher has collaborated with the brand on several takes on Spezials).</div>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div>Other predictions: the comeback of skater trainers that “could have been stolen from your best friend’s older brother’s room in 2002, swiped from next to his Playstation 2”, as British Vogue’s Daisy Jones recently observed. Based on the omnipresence of AI and material innovations, I predict some technological elements to be thrown into the mix, too. Along with a continued obsession with performance trainers and Gorpcore (Salmons, Hokas, Merrells, Vibrams, and Asics continue to dominate here) and pitch-worthy styles inspired by the women’s Euros. Of course, there will also be an endless stream of collaborations. Scroll on for six trainer trends to note for 2025.

            </div>
            <h2>Partnerships, partnerships, partnerships</h2>
            <div>Collaborations have always been a powerful tool on the sneaker landscape, with the most coveted styles selling at inflated prices on resale sites long after their initial release. This year saw continued success for the ongoing partnerships between Wales Bonner and Adidas and Miu Miu and New Balance. With more brands jumping on the bandwagon at every turn, expect 2025 to be big on the collaboration front.</div>

            <h2>Step back in time</h2>
            <div>Sneaker wins of recent years have been steeped in nostalgia. Are yesteryear shoes bound for a return? Nike’s Noughties-hailing Shox–as Daisy put it, the “anti-Samba,” which were reinterpreted as a mule by Martine Rose–Air Max 95s and 97s (the trainers of choice among ravers during my uni years), as well as the more humble Air Max 1s and Converse. British Vogue’s Daniel Rodgers and I have also discussed whether he should bring back his Balenciaga Triple Ss (granted, they’re only seven years old, but they still feel kind of nostalgic) or whether they’re still too earnest.</div>

            </div>
            <h2>What are those?</h2>
            <div>My former British Vogue colleague Alex Kessler road-tested New Balance’s 1906L loafer-trainers ahead of their launch last year–one of the many sneaker hybrids that entered the chat in 2024. Elsewhere, Cecilie Bahnsen released sporty Mary Janes via her collaboration with Asics and Simone Rocha experimented with track-soled ballerinas, while Salomon unveiled a backless mule version of its XT-4 silhouette, made in collaboration with MM6 Maison Margiela. Salomon also joined forces with Sandy Liang to create coquettish ribboned sneakers–which tapped into the customization trend of adding charms, chains, and jewelry that has swept social feeds. This is a movement that Molly Rooyakkers, founder of @Style.Analytics, says can make “an otherwise standard item feel personal.”</div>

                </div>
            <h2>Sk8er</h2>
            <div>Skater shoes are back. Though, puffy skater trainers shouldn’t reach Samba status–it would ruin their charm. The antithesis of streamlined silhouettes that have dominated of late, these chunky foamy stompers are shouty, bold and, brazen. It takes the right styling to wear them; they’re not for everyone. A statement shoe by definition, but not a statement shoe by design. Vans, though, could be destined for mass appeal: I’ve seen a noticeable uptick in both the slip-ons and Old Skools, worn by the same crowd that were early endorsers of Sambas.</div>

            </div>
            <h2>Pitch kicks</h2>
            <div>“With the women’s Euros coming up in summer 2025, get ready to see even more football-inspired sneakers everywhere,” asserts Rachel Makar, senior director of merchandising at StockX. Football fever already took over fashion during the men’s Euros–football shirts and scarves became a style fixture off the pitch–so prepare for 2.0 next summer. At the same time, Oasis will be on their reunion tour–Britpop is also, of course, intrinsically linked with football culture–so prepare to see fans rocking three-stripe trainers (and parkas, and mod cuts…).

            </div>
            <h2>Gorphardcore</h2>
            <div>Gorpcore is no longer a trend–it’s a lifestyle. I’ve overheard many a gorpy garb chat around my East London local, dispensed by guys dressed in parachute Gramicci trousers or Needles trackies, Beams cardigans and some kind of waterproof; ambling about with an ARCS bag slung across their body. They pine after performance trainers, including Salomons, Merrells, Hokas, and Asics—the latter of which has out-performed most running shoe brands according to Emily Minea, director of merchandising at GOAT, who dubs it “the ultimate nondescript running brand.” I’ve also heard a couple of cliché Hackney dwellers moot the idea of Vibram V-Trails and wondered if they’d be down for Tabi trainers, should they enter the mainstream beyond Margiela—Molly predicts toe details could gain traction in 2025.
