        <h1>Why Do I Suddenly Want Adidas Sambas?</h1>

        <div>Over the last few years, one sneaker has dominated the zeitgeist: Adidas Sambas. While you could hardly walk down the
        block without seeing the sleek sneaker, they also enchanted celebrities—Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid, and Harry Styles
        among them. The sneakers have spawned collaborations from the likes of Wales Bonner, Dover Street Market, and even
        Dinsey. But after a prolonged period of exposure, it seems like the Samba hype is finally dying down. So why do I want a
        pair now more than ever?
        
        Struck with a case of Not Like the Other Girls Syndrome, I resisted buying Sambas when they were poised to become the
        next big sneaker, sticking instead to my checkerboard Vans slip-ons and lace-up Pumas. But I couldn’t help but admire
        the Sambas’ slim silhouette as I saw people like Kaia Gerber, Hailey Bieber, and Gigi Hadid incorporate them into their
        everyday style. Even Harry Styles and Paul Mescal gave me pangs of envy when I saw them in their kicks.
